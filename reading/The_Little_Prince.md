## Chapter 3
> He sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time.Then,taking my sheep out of his pocket,he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.

翻译：他陷入了长时间的沉思，之后，他从口袋里掏出我的羊(我画的🐑)，看着他的宝贝入了神。

## Chapter 4
> if you were to say to the grown-ups, “I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick,with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,” they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them,”I saw a house that cost $20,000.” Then they would exclaim, “Oh, what a pretty house that is!”

翻译：如果你对大人们说 ：“我看到一幢漂亮的红砖房子，窗台上摆着天竺葵，屋顶上还有鸽子，”他们怎么也想象不出这房子能有多好。你必须对他们说：“我看见了一幢价值两万美元的房子。”他们就会惊叫道：“多么漂亮的房子啊！”

> give a much greater air of truth

翻译：给人一种更加真实的感觉

> To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend.And if I forget him,I may become like the grewn-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures…

> as true to life as possible

> So I fumble along as best as I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair to middling.

## Chapter 6

> One day I saw the sunset forty-four times! You konw, one loves the sunset, when one is so sad...

翻译：曾经有一天，我看了44次日落。你知道吗，心里难过的时候，人们总是喜欢看日落。

> If someone loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself, ‘Somewhere, my flower is there...’ But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened...

翻译：如果有人爱上这亿万星辰中独一无二的一朵花，单单是望着这满天星辰就足以使他感到幸福。他可以对自己说：”看，在那个地方，我爱的花在那儿...“。如果小羊吃掉了这朵花，这满天星辰将瞬间暗淡...

## Chapter 8

> The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her, I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little strategies. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her.

翻译：我那时真是什么也不懂！我应该看她做的事，而不是听她说的话。有了她，我的生活才芬芳多彩。我真不该离开她的，我应该猜到她的那些小花招后隐藏着的感情。花儿都言行不一！但是我当时太年轻了，不懂怎么去爱。

## Chapter 10

> It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom.


翻译：审判自己比审判别人要难得多啊。审判好自己，那么你就是一位真正的智者
